This script downloads the HTML version of [ZSH User's Guide](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/) and converts it to an EPUB file.
It can be useful if you have an old e-book reader that doesn't support reading HTML files.

Most of the code is based on this excellent tutorial: [Build a digital book with EPUB](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/tutorials/x-epubtut/index.html).
